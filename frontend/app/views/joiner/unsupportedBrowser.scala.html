                            To join Guardian Membership, you'll need a modern browser
                            that can run Javascript - without that we can't take your payment.
                            Unfortunately, it looks like you'll need to upgrade
                            your browser:
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="action-group">
                    <a class="action" href="http://www.whatbrowser.org/intl/en_uk/">Check your browser version</a>
