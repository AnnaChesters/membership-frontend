        It’s almost 200 years since the Guardian first appeared in print. And we’re just a few years off notching
        up 20 years online. Now, we've given the paper a whole new dimension, with the introduction of a live element.
        Why? Because we don’t do monologues, we have conversations - and we want to have them with you, in real life.
        We want to get closer to our readers, so we can exchange ideas and learn from each other. 
        We want you to help us to seek out the stories that matter, keep our award-winning journalism as open, 
        accessible and relevant as possible and, collectively, to promote the open exchange of ideas and ideals 
        around the world. Join us today as a friend, partner or patron.
