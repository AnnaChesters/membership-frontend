        <p>It’s almost 200 years since the Guardian first appeared in print. And we’re just a few years off notching
        up 20 years online. Now, we've given the paper a whole new dimension, with the introduction of a live element.
        Why? Because we don’t do monologues, we have conversations - and we want to have them with you, in real life.
        We want to get closer to our readers, so we can exchange ideas and learn from each other.
        We want you to help us to seek out the stories that matter, keep our award-winning journalism as open,
        accessible and relevant as possible and, collectively, to promote the open exchange of ideas and ideals
        around the world. Join us today as a friend, partner or patron.</p>

        <h2>Guardian Live events</h2>

	<p>When we say live element, we really mean it: Guardian Live is our rolling programme of events that includes everything
	from lectures by some of the world’s foremost thinkers and talkers to exclusive screenings of the latest indy films;
	from Meet the Journalist sessions at our offices in Kings Place to more intimate, bespoke events. For example,
	on Saturday 15 October, the Weekend magazine crew are heading west from to Notting Hill for a slap-up brunch with
	Yotam Ottolenghi and guests (that’s you) at Tabernacle. And later this month, Guardian feature writer Kira Cochrane
	will be sitting on a comfy sofa at RIBA, chatting to national treasure Clare Balding.</p>

	<p>You can check out the full list of what’s on here {link to events calendar}.When you join the Guardian as a friend, partner or patron, you can book tickets for all of our Guardian Live events. You’re also entitled to:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>
			<h4>Discounts</h4>
			<p>Our partners and patrons get a 20% discount on tickets to all our Guardian Life events (the discount applies to +1 tickets as well).</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<h4>Early booking</h4>
			<p>Tickets to our events can sometimes go quickly, so we give you the chance to get in early, to make sure you get a seat. Patrons get a two-week heads up before tickets go on general sale. For partners, it’s one week.</p>

Patrons and partners get a 20% discount on most Masterclasses.</p>

	<h2>Guardian Space</h2>

	<p>For the moment, our events will take place at a number of venues around London and the UK. But come January 2016,
we'll be flinging open the doors to Space, the new and permanent home for Guardian Live events. Situated just across
the road from our offices in King’s Cross, it won't be just a lecture theatre; we want Space to be your space too.
A place where you can meet old friends and new, share ideas and great conversations, learn something, expand your
mind or just sit back and relax. And if you can't wait until 2016 to see how it’s shaping up, don’t worry; we'll be
running regular visits for patrons between now and then.</p>
