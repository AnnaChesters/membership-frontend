    <li>What is Guardian membership?

    Guardian membership is a community of people who share our belief that the open exchange of information,
    ideas and opinions can change the world for the better. By signing up and paying your subscription 
    (at Partner and Patron level), you are helping us to bring those words to life by supporting our open, independent 
     and liberal journalism. In return, you get access to events and experiences that are only available to our members.

    <li>Why should I join? 
        
    If you want to support the Guardian and its journalism, then signing up to Guardian membership and paying your 
    subscription is a great way to do it. But, even if you don’t feel strongly about what we do, membership has a 
    lot to offer. Benefits include access to our Guardian Live events programme. The events range from lectures by 
    some of the world’s foremost thinkers and talkers to exclusive screenings of the latest indy films; from Meet 
    the Journalist sessions at our offices in Kings Place to more intimate, bespoke events. 
    Tickets are only available to Guardian members.</li>
