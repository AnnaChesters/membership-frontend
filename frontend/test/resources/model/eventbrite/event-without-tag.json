So it's little surprise that Excel power users can earn more money, and qualify for more jobs than those with a lesser command of the application. But advanced Excel skills don't just look good on a CV – as this course demonstrates, they empower users with real-world skills for work, home and study. For this transformative series of evening seminars, expert Excel tutor <STRONG>Abbott Katz</STRONG> has designed four capsule masterclasses, each of which unlocks a new element of the software's most powerful, and least known, functions.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Session one, on how to use pivot tables, enables users to access myriad ways to analyse figures to spot and quantify trends. Knowledge of Excel's formulas and functions opens up new ways to organise and interpret data during session two. During session three, you'll learn how Excel's exceptional visual enhancements are not just for appearance's sake. Finally, session four, on grabbing and grooming the numbers, unlocks a suite of technical abilities, allowing you to easily import and format data from other applications, and ensure your spreadsheets are as elegant as they are foolproof.</SPAN></P>\r\n<P><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\"><STRONG>Each course is bookable as an individual session, or you can book onto all four session for the discount price of £349<BR></STRONG></SPAN></P>\r\n<H2><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">This course is for you if...</SPAN></H2>\r\n<UL>\r\n<LI><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">You currently use Excel for work or study and want to improve your performance, or find elegant solutions to current problems</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">You work with data and want to make better use of it</SPAN></LI>\r\n<LI><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">You want to learn valuable new skills to improve your CV</SPAN></LI>\r\n</UL>\r\n<P><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">PLEASE NOTE: Attendees should be comfortable with Excel's basic functions</SPAN></P>\r\n<H2><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">Course description</SPAN></H2>\r\n<P><SPAN STYLE=\"font-size: small; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;\">These four lively seminars explain Excel's advanced functions in easy-to-follow language. Each session is conceived as a standalone primer in a single area of expertise, but combine to give a comprehensive overview of Excel's most useful tools.

        "text": "Get more out of Excel than you ever thought possible  \nExcel isn't just for arranging data – it gives skilled users the tools to interrogate it as well, to find valuable new insights. So it's little surprise that Excel power users can earn more money, and qualify for more jobs than those with a lesser command of the application. But advanced Excel skills don't just look good on a CV – as this course demonstrates, they empower users with real-world skills for work, home and study. For this transformative series of evening seminars, expert Excel tutor Abbott Katz has designed four capsule masterclasses, each of which unlocks a new element of the software's most powerful, and least known, functions. \nSession one, on how to use pivot tables, enables users to access myriad ways to analyse figures to spot and quantify trends. Knowledge of Excel's formulas and functions opens up new ways to organise and interpret data during session two. During session three, you'll learn how Excel's exceptional visual enhancements are not just for appearance's sake. Finally, session four, on grabbing and grooming the numbers, unlocks a suite of technical abilities, allowing you to easily import and format data from other applications, and ensure your spreadsheets are as elegant as they are foolproof. \nEach course is bookable as an individual session, or you can book onto all four session for the discount price of £349  \nThis course is for you if... \n\nYou currently use Excel for work or study and want to improve your performance, or find elegant solutions to current problems\nYou work with data and want to make better use of it\nYou want to learn valuable new skills to improve your CV\n\nPLEASE NOTE: Attendees should be comfortable with Excel's basic functions \nCourse description \nThese four lively seminars explain Excel's advanced functions in easy-to-follow language.
