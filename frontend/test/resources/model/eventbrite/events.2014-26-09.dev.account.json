Detailed hand-outs ensure this course offers a long-term benefit to your communications. \nCourse description \nThe data visualisation course will look at how raw data can be turned into striking visual stories. In the first session, we will look at flat graphic design (infographics) and how visual storytelling techniques can enhance the impact and memorability of your work. In the second session, we will look at interactives and interface design. \nThe third and fourth sessions are workshops which will give attendees experience of working at a simulated digital agency. They will be organised into groups and encouraged to find their own datasets and asked to wireframe either a flat or interactive design. Then, using the relevant software, they will be encouraged to turn their wireframe into a publishable piece of work. The end result will be a finished piece of data visualisation that can be submitted to either a magazine, website or blog. We will advise on the best routes to publication. \nThe course will alternate between presentations and workshop elements. Attendees will need to bring laptops; however note that many of the tasks will simply involve pen and paper. Although we do discuss software, and encourage people to use relevant software to create charts in the workshop sessions, please note that this is not a software training course. \nThe masterclass is designed for... \n\nThose who have to present for a living, using Powerpoint, Prezi or similar software.\n\u2022Those who work with data and wish to learn more about turning data into something visually compelling.\n\u2022Designers who wish to learn more about information graphics and create a data visualisation piece for their portfolio.\n\u2022Developers who are interested in creating more usable and elegant front-end solutions.\n\n  \nPlease note:\u00a0This Masterclass is not intended to be corporate training but instead is an introduction to the principles and practices of data visualisation for interested individuals. Corporate training can be arranged separately with courses tailored to specific requirements.

In the first session, we will look at flat graphic design (infographics) and how visual storytelling techniques can enhance the impact and memorability of your work. In the second session, we will look at interactives and interface design.<\/SPAN><\/P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.6rem; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: EgyptianText, georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 24px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: medium;\">The third and fourth sessions are workshops which will give attendees experience of working at a simulated digital agency. They will be organised into groups and encouraged to find their own datasets and asked to wireframe either a flat or interactive design. Then, using the relevant software, they will be encouraged to turn their wireframe into a publishable piece of work. The end result will be a finished piece of data visualisation that can be submitted to either a magazine, website or blog. We will advise on the best routes to publication.<\/SPAN><\/P>\r\n<P STYLE=\"margin: 0px 0px 1.6rem; padding: 0px; color: #333333; font-family: EgyptianText, georgia, serif; font-size: 16px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: 24px; orphans: auto; text-align: start; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: auto; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: #ffffff;\"><SPAN STYLE=\"font-family: georgia, palatino; font-size: medium;\">The course will alternate between presentations and workshop elements.
